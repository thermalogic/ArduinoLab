# How to Use a Breadboard

## Introduction

Breadboards are one of the most fundamental pieces when learning how to build circuits. 

In this tutorial, you will learn a little bit about what breadboards are, why they are called breadboards, and how to use one. 

Once you are done you should have a basic understanding of how breadboards work and be able to build a basic circuit on a breadboard.

## History

If you wanted to build a circuit prior to the 1960s, chances are you would have used a technique called wire-wrap. Wire wrap is a process that involves wrapping wires around conductive posts attached to a perfboard (a.k.a. a protoboard). 

As you can see, the process can get rather complex very quickly.

Although this method is still used today, there is something that makes prototyping much easier, breadboards!

### What’s in a Name?
When you picture a breadboard in your head, you may envision a big piece of wood and a large loaf of freshly baked bread. 

You wouldn’t be too far off either.

So why do we call this electronic `“circuit builder”` a breadboard? 

Many years ago, when electronics were big and bulky, people would grab the nearest breadboard, a few nails or thumbtacks, and start connecting wires onto the board to give themselves a platform on which to build their circuits.

Since then, electronic components have gotten a lot smaller, and we’ve come up with better ways to connect circuits, making people all over the world happy to have their breadboards back. However, we are stuck with the confusing name. Technically, these are still breadboards, but this discussion is going to be on modern, "solderless" breadboards.

## Why Use Breadboards?

An electronics breadboard (as opposed to the type on which sandwiches are made) is actually referring to a **solderless breadboard**. These are great units for making temporary circuits and prototyping, and they require absolutely no soldering.

`Prototyping` is the process of testing out an idea by creating a preliminary model from which other forms are developed or copied, and it is one of the most common uses for breadboards. If you aren’t sure how a circuit will react under a given set of parameters, it’s best to build a prototype and test it out.

For those new to electronics and circuits, breadboards are often the best place to start. That is the real beauty of breadboards--they can house both the simplest circuit as well as very complex circuits. As you'll see later in this tutorial, if your circuit outgrows its current breadboard, others can be be attached to accommodate circuits of all sizes and complexities.

Another common use of breadboards is testing out new parts, such as Integrated circuits (ICs). When you are trying to figure out how a part works and constantly rewiring things, you don’t want to have to solder your connections each time.

As mentioned, you don’t always want the circuit you build to be permanent. When trying to duplicate a customer’s problem, SparkFun’s Technical Support team will often use breadboards to build, test, and analyze the circuit. They can connect the parts the customer has, and once they’ve gotten the circuit setup and figured out the problem, they can take everything apart and put it aside for the next time they need to do some troubleshooting.

## Anatomy of a Breadboard

The best way to explain how a breadboard works is to take it apart and see what’s inside.

Using a smaller breadboard it’s easier to see just how they function.
