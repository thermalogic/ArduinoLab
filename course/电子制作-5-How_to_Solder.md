# How to Solder:Through-Hole Soldering

##  Introduction

Soldering is one of the most fundamental skills needed to dabble in the world of electronics. 

The two go together like peas and carrots. And, although it is possible to learn about and build electronics without needing to pick up a soldering iron, you'll soon discover that a whole new world is opened with this one simple skill. We here at SparkFun believe that soldering should be a skill in everyone's arsenal. In a world of increasing technological surroundings, we believe it is important that people everywhere be able to not only understand the technologies they use everyday but also be able to build, alter, and fix them as well. 

Soldering is one of many skills that will empower you to do just that.
